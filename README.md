# Hotel Booking & Messaging App

## Description

This is a full-stack web application that enables two types of users â€” **Clients** and **Managers** â€” to interact within a hotel booking ecosystem. Clients can explore hotel listings, view hotel details, and start conversations with the hotel's management. Managers can log in, view the hotels they manage, check client conversations, and respond to them. The conversations are stored in Firebase Firestore and are organized by hotel and client.

This application emphasizes clear role separation, dynamic routing, and persistent message history between users. It also integrates local storage to maintain session state across routes.
